# üìö Technical Documentation Page

This project is part of my journey through the **freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design** course. It fulfills all the user stories required to create a structured and responsive technical documentation page.

## üìÑ Project Overview

The Technical Documentation Page project is designed to present information in a structured and easily navigable format. It includes a main content area, sections with headers, a sticky navigation bar, and responsive design features.

## üöÄ User Stories

This project meets the following user stories:

1. You can see a `main` element with a corresponding `id="main-doc"`, which contains the page's main content (technical documentation).

2. Within the `#main-doc` element, you can see several `section` elements, each with a class of `main-section`. There should be a minimum of five.

3. The first element within each `.main-section` should be a `header` element, which contains text that describes the topic of that section.

4. Each `section` element with the class of `main-section` should also have an `id` that corresponds with the text of each header contained within it. Any spaces should be replaced with underscores (e.g., The section that contains the header "JavaScript and Java" should have a corresponding `id="JavaScript_and_Java"`).

5. The `.main-section` elements should contain at least ten `p` elements total (not each).

6. The `.main-section` elements should contain at least five `code` elements total (not each).

7. The `.main-section` elements should contain at least five `li` items total (not each).

8. You can see a `nav` element with a corresponding `id="navbar"`.

9. The `navbar` element should contain one `header` element, which contains text that describes the topic of the technical documentation.

10. Additionally, the `navbar` should contain `link` (`a`) elements with the class of `nav-link`. There should be one for every element with the class `main-section`.

11. The `header` element in the `#navbar` must come before any `link` (`a`) elements in the navbar.

12. Each element with the class of `nav-link` should contain text that corresponds to the header text within each section (e.g., if you have a "Hello world" section/header, your navbar should have an element that contains the text "Hello world").

13. When you click on a `navbar` element, the page should navigate to the corresponding section of the `#main-doc` element (e.g., If you click on a `.nav-link` element that contains the text "Hello world", the page navigates to a `section` element with that id, and contains the corresponding header).

14. On regular-sized devices (laptops, desktops), the element with `id="navbar"` should be shown on the left side of the screen and should always be visible to the user.

15. Your technical documentation should use at least one media query.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use

To view and interact with the Technical Documentation Page project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anirudha-8/technical-documentation.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Folder**:

    ```bash
    cd technical-documentation
    ```

3. **Open the Project**:

    Open the index.html file in your web browser to view the technical documentation page:

    ```bash
    open index.html
    ```

    Or double-click index.html to open it in your default browser.

## üéØ Project Objectives

- Create a responsive and well-structured technical documentation page.

- Ensure that all user stories are met with proper HTML structure and CSS styling.

- Implement media queries for responsive design on different devices.

## üåü Key Features

- **Sticky Navbar**: A navigation bar that stays visible on the left side of the screen on regular-sized devices.

- **Responsive Design**: Media queries ensure the page is accessible and well-formatted on different devices.

- **Structured Content**: The content is organized into sections with headers for easy navigation.
